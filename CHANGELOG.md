# Change Log

We are not following semantic versioning in this template app since any change could potentially be
a breaking change for forked customization projects. We are still experimenting with what is a good
way to update this template, but currently, we follow a pattern:

- Major version change (v**X**.0.0): Changes to several pages and other components. Consider
  implementing this without merging upstream (we'll provide instructions).
- Minor version change (v0.**X**.0): New features and changes to a single page. These are likely to
  cause conflicts.
- Patch (v0.0.**X**): Bug fixes and small changes to components.

## [v8.0.0] 2021-02-17

This major release adds support for code-splitting using
[Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/). At this point, we added route-based code
splitting, which meant changes to routeConfiguration.js and how "loadData" & "setInitialValues"

[v6.0.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v5.0.0...v6.0.0

## [v5.0.0] 2020-06-04

- [change] Streamlining filter setup. Everyone who customizes FTW-templates, needs to update filters
  and unfortunately the related code has been spread out in multiple UI containers.

  Now, filters are more configurable through marketplace-custom-config.js. You can just add new
  filter configs to `filters` array in there - and that should be enough for creating new filters
  for extended data.

  If your are creating a totally new filter component, you can take it into use in a single file:
  src/containers/SearchPage/FilterComponent.js

  In addition, we have renamed couple of container components:

  - SearchFilters -> SearchFiltersPrimary
  - SearchFiltersPanel -> SearchFiltersSecondary (SearchFiltersMobile has kept its name.)

  SortBy filter's state is also tracked similarly as filters. From now on, the state is kept in
  MainPanel and not in those 3 different UI containers.

  [v4.2.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v4.1.0...v4.2.0

## [v4.1.0] 2020-02-03

- [fix] Remove unused 'invalid' prop that breaks some versions of Final Form
  [#1255](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1255)

  [v4.0.1]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0

## [v4.0.0] 2019-12-19

- [change] Use Stripe's [Connect onboarding](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/connect-onboarding) for
  adding and updating the identity information of the Stripe account.
  - Before updating to this version you should check
    [the related pull request](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1234)
  - Read more from documentation:
    [How to handle provider onboarding and identity verification on FTW](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/guides/provider-onboarding-and-identity-verification/)

**Note:** In this update we have deprecated the old `PayoutDetailsForm` and `PayoutPreferencesPage`.
Form now on Stripe will handle collecting the identity information required for verificating the
Stripe account. On FTW we will only handle creating the new account and adding and updating
information about bank account (e.g. IBAN number). If you want to keep using the custom form inside
your application you need to make sure that you are collecting all the required information and
enabling users to update the account so that it doesn't get restricted.

- [fix] Add missing props to examples related to EditListingWizard
  [#1247](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1247)

- [change] Make it easier to reorder EditListingWizard tabs/panels.
  [#1240](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1240)
- [change] In `PayoutDetailsForm` show states (US and AU) and provinces (CA) in dropdown instead of
  input. Since November 18, 2019 Stripe has been validating these values (read more
  https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-address-validation).
- [add] Add IconEdit [#1237](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1237)

  [v3.7.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v3.6.1...v3.7.0

## [v3.6.1] 2019-11-26

- [fix] Fix XSS-vulnerability on SearchPage where URL param 'address' was exposed directly to
  schema, which is just a script tag: <script type="application/ld+json">. On server-side, this
  could leak malformed HTML through to browsers and made it possible to inject own script tags.

However, CSP prevents any data breach: injected js can't send data to unknonwn 3rd party sites.

NOTE: Check that `REACT_APP_CSP` is in block mode on your production environment. You can read more
from Flex docs: https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-csp-for-ftw/

  [#1225](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1225)
- [change] Update @sentry/browser and @sentry/node from 5.6.2 to 5.7.1. Due to some refactoring
  Sentry has done internally which is included to this update, you might need to remove
  `node_modules` and run `yarn install` again.

## [v3.5.1] 2019-09-16

- [add] add orverriding function `onAdd` and `onRemove` for `CustomOverlayView` in
  `SearchMapWithGoogleMap` to abide to React rules and do not `unmountComponentAtNode` when a
  component is rendered by React and use `appendChild` on `onAdd` instead of `draw` to
  [improve performance](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps/issues/817).
  [#1200](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1200)
- [fix] fix `CustomOverlayView` in `SearchMapWithGoogleMap` to work with new `react-intl` version,
  overriding `render` method to render child object by using `createPortal` instead of
  `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`.
  [#1200](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1200)

  [#1190](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1190)

  [v3.5.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v3.4.0...v3.5.0

## [v3.4.0] 2019-08-29

- [change] Update `react-intl` to 3.1.13. More information about the changes can be found from
  [Upgrade guide for react-intl@3.x](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/Upgrade-Guide.md)

  - Proptype `intlShape` was removed so we needed to create it again. Because of this we added a new
    `util/reactIntl.js` file. This file is now used to wrap all the react-intl related imports.
  - `addLocaleDate` function was removed and react-intl library is now relying on native Intl APIs:
    [Intl.PluralRules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/PluralRules)
    and
    [Intl.RelativeTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RelativeTimeFormat).
    In order to support older browsers we needed to add `intl-pluralrules` and
    `intl-relativetimeformat` to `util/polyfills.js`
  - Also Node must be now compiled with `full-icu` which caused changes to `start` and `test`
    scripts in `package.json`. We also needed to add a specific config for `nodemon`
  - Default `textComponent`in `IntlProvider` changed to `React.Fragment` so we need to explicitly
    set `textComponent` to `span`. Otherwise all the snapshots would have changed and it might
    affect to UI if there is styles added to these spans generally in customization projects.

    Note: `FormattedMessage` component now supports
    [`tagName` prop](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/Components.md#formattedmessage)
    and
    [improved rich-text formatting](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/Components.md#rich-text-formatting).
    [#1181](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1181)

  [#1188](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1188)
- [change] Update `React`, `react-test-renderer` and `react-dom` to 16.9.0. After these updates old
  lifecycle methods `componentWillMount`, `componentWillUpdate` and `componentWillUpdate` will cause
  deprecation warnings. Check the updated components from the PR

  [#1174](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1174)
- [change] Update final-form, final-form-arrays, react-final-form and react-final-form-arrays. This
  forced to make some code changes:

  - Old recommendation of by-passing default field formatting or parsin isn't accepted anymore
    - `format={null}` => use identity function instead: `format={v => v}`
    - `parse={null}` => use identity function instead: `parse={v => v}`
  - Final Form passes input props (name, value, onChange, onBlur, etc. ) grouped inside input key
    - those props now include `type` attribute too.
  - We had old form naming pattern with prop 'form', which now conflicted with updated Final Form
    (The 'form' prop was used when Redux-Form was the form library)

  [v2.17.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.16.0...v2.17.0

## [v2.16.0] 2019-05-08

This release makes 2 big updates to `sharetribe-scripts` package (which is our fork from Create
React App). It is updated from v1.1.5 ->
[2.1.8](https://github.com/sharetribe/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG-2.x.md#migrating-from-1x-to-203)
-> [3.0.0](https://github.com/sharetribe/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). This brought up
a couple of changes:

- package.json has now a **"browserlist"** configuration key. This gives you an option to affect
  browser support (it affects CSS Autoprefixer and JS build output).
  [You might want to update it.](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1073)
- IE support is removed from Create React App, but you can add polyfills yourself if needed.
- React was updated to a version that supports _Hooks_ and _Rules of React_ eslint plugin is
  included.
- All the npm vulnerability report exceptions were removed from `.auditrc`

There was also a couple of bug fixes you should check carefully:
[#1082](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1082),
[#1084](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1084).

**Changes:**

- [fix] Previous change from `currentUser.attributes.stripeConnected` to separately included
  `stripeAccount` caused errors since updates to currentUser entity didn't include `stripeAccount`.
  Including it every time sounds quite error-prone, so we reversed that change.
  [#1084](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1084)
- [fix] Edit `updatedEntities` function in `util/data.js` so that it doesn't mutate the
  `oldEntities` argument. [#1079](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1079)
- [change] Update sharetribe-scripts (CRA fork) to v3.0.0. There are a couple of changes that you
  should check from [#1081](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1081)
  - Reserve use\* function naming pattern for React Hooks.
  - Recent SDK update changed the proptypes for snapshots.
  - Updated scripts/config.js after Prettier version bump
  - Removed unnecessary audit exceptions
- [fix] Ensure on `TransactionPage` that all the required data is loaded before showing the page.

- [fix] Use proper method for Sentry on logout to avoid error message.
  [#1080](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1080),
- [change] Update sharetribe-scripts (CRA fork) to v2.1.8. There are a couple of changes that you
  should check from [#1073](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1073)
  - package.json has now a "browserlist" configuration key. This gives you an option to affect
    Autoprefixer configs (aka CSS vendor prefixes / browser support). You might want to update it.
  - IE support is removed from Create React App, but you can add polyfills yourself if needed.
  - Test snapshots were also changed a bit. (Update your own custom tests if needed.)
  - Some CSS and React rules were more strict, you might need to make changes to your custom code.
- [fix] New npm vulnerability alerts checked and added to exception list.

- [add] Use sparse fields on SearchPage to reduce data load.
  [#1066](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1066)

  - NOTE: if you need more fields on `ListingCard` than title, price and geolocation - you need to
    add those to `loadData` function.

  [#1062](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1062)
- [fix] US individual accounts had a non-editable business url in PayoutDetailsForm. It was probably
  OK, but there wasn't any reason to for it.
  [#1061](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1061)

  [v2.14.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.13.1...v2.14.0

## [v2.13.1] 2019-03-29

- [add] a comment about category and amenities filters. They don't work out-of-the-box, extended
  data needs a schema before it can work as a search filter.
  [#1055](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1055)
- [fix] EditListingWizard: currentUser was null when the EditListingPage got reloaded causing
  TypeError. [#1056](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1056)

  [v2.13.1]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.13.0...v2.13.1

## [v2.13.0] 2019-03-28

  [#1052](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1052)
- [fix] JPY currency was configured wrongly: it doesn't use subunits.
  [#1051](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1051)
- [add] Complete rewrite to `PayoutDetailsForm` due to breaking changes in Stripe API.
  [#1049](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1049)
  - You should track all your customizations to `PayoutDetailsForm` and related changes in
    `user.duck.js` and elsewhere before merging this upstream-update.
  - You should update Stripe API to "2019-02-19" or later
- [add] Booking: use attributes `displayStart` and `displayEnd`, instead of reading booking period
  directly from `start` and `end` attributes.
  [#1050](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1050)
- [fix] A listing title that contained only stripped-off characters caused bugs in slug / pathName
  generation. [#1048](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1048)
- [change] Removed Node-engine setup from package.json. Fixed version was causing problems for quite
  many in their first FTW installation. Note: when troubleshooting your Heroku installation, you
  might want to reintroduce engine setup.
  [#1043](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1043)
- [fix] Add error handling to `PayoutDetailsForm` and `StripePaymentForm` in case Stripe publishable
  key is not configured yet. [#1042](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1042)
- [fix] FieldBirthdayInput: placeholder text was not selected by default.
  [#1039](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1039)

  [v2.13.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.12.1...v2.13.0

## [v2.12.0] 2019-02-28

- [fix] Fix to PR [#1035](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1035). In
  `user.duck.js` send correct params depending on Stripe API in use.
  [#1037](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1037)
- [change] Update creating Stripe account token to support the latest Stripe API update. See also
  [Stripe API changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-changelog). **IMPORTANT:** If you are
  using a Stripe account created earlier than 19th of February 2019 you need to change the value of
  `useDeprecatedLegalEntityWithStripe` in `stripe-config.js`. You can check the Stripe API version
  you are using from Stripe Dashboard -> Developers. Since the change in Stripe API was quite big we
  are not able to support company accounts with new Stripe API yet! The option for company accounts
  will be hidden if the value `useDeprecatedLegalEntityWithStripe` is set to `false`.
  [#1035](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1035)
- [change] Improve German translations.
  [#1034](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1034)
- [change] Reordered import/exports on src/components/index.js. This helps to mitigate possible
  circular dependency problems and strange bugs in CSS bundle. In addition, derivative buttons were
  refactored to work with `rootClassName` prop (PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton and
  InlineTextButton). [#1024](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1024)

  [v2.12.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.11.1...v2.12.0

## [v2.11.1] 2019-02-21

- [add] New translations for French and Spanish (fr.json & es.json)
  [#1028](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1028)
- [add] New translation file German (de.json). This also adds hyphenation to some of the titles.
  [#1027](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1027)

  [v2.11.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.11.0...v2.11.1

## [v2.11.0] 2019-02-20

- [fix] SelectMultipleFilter had a bug on mobile layout - `onSubmit` didn't get called. This fixes
  also two other issues with SelectMultipleFilter: hovering on ListingCard removed dirty values on
  repaint and there was an outline flashing on FilterForm when clicking checkboxes.
  [#1025](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1025)
- [fix] Small changes in CSS files in order to match content width with the footer in pages where
  the footer is visible. Also, make side layout (used e.g. in `TermsOfServicePage`, `InboxPage`,
  `ContactDetailsPage`) align width footer better. Check responsive layouts carefulle after taking
  update from upstream. [#1090](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1019)
- [add] This adds an example how user-generated content could be sanitized. If you have extended
  data you should consider if sanitization is needed for that.
  [#1023](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1023)
- [change] A new component `UserDisplayName` is added for showing user display name and also
  handling the cases where a user is banned or deleted. When the user name must be a string instead
  of a component (e.g. in `Avatar` and in `ListingPage`) you can use a new function
  `userDisplayNameAsString`. Together these will replace the old `userDisplayName` function which is
  now deprecated. Also some small bug fixes to showing banned user. There is quite a lot of file
  changes caused by updating test files.
  [#1022](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1022)
- [change] Remove error handling for unverified email from PasswordRecoveryPage and translations
  related to that. [#1021](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1021)

  node security platform (nsp), but that service was closed on December 2018.
  [#1020](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1020)
- [change] Extracted and refactored utility functions related to transaction and refactored several
  components that show transaction data (incl. InboxPage, TransactionPanel, ActivityFeed). Before
  updating your customization project, you should read more about what has changed from the pull
  request. [#1004](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1004)
- [change] Rest of the documentation moved to Flex Docs: https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/
  [#1015](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1015)

  [v2.10.0]: https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/compare/v2.9.0...v2.10.0

    [#1016](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1016)

  [#1011](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1011)

  [#1012](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1012) and
  [#1014](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1014)
- [fix] Allow ownListing as listing proptype in BookingPanel component.
  [#1007](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1007)

  [#1006](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1006)
- [change] Default to English translation if the translation key is missing. After this update, new
  translation keys will not be added to other translation files with English default texts. We keep
  providing translations in our supported languages but they might not be up to date all the time.
  This means if you want to update your translations beforehand or use your own translations file,
  you can use
  [translation CLI](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/blob/master/docs/translations.md#managing-translations)
  to check if there are translations missing.
  [#1005](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1005)

  [#994](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/994)
- [change] Change from Raven to Sentry SDKs for browser and Node.js to version 4.5.1. With the new
  SDKs only one DSN needs to be configured so update also environment variables and documentation
  related to Sentry. [#999](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/999)
- [fix] Use environment variable `REACT_APP_AVAILABILITY_ENABLED` to enable or disable availability
  calendar. In the config.js file variable fetchAvailableTimeSlots is now renamed to more general
  enableAvailability because it affects both fetching availability data and enabling the
  availability calendar. [#1000](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/1000)
- [fix] UI was broken for banned user after transaction enquiry changes.
  [#996](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/996)

  subcomponents. Multiple new translation keys were added and they might not be translated into
  French yet. [#980](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/980)
- Manage availability of listings. This works for listings that have booking unit type:
  'line-item/night', or 'line-item/day'. There's also 'manage availability' link in the
  ManageListingCards of "your listings" page.
  [#972](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/972)

  translations depending on booking unit chosen in config.

  **Note:** You must define min and max for the filter in `src/marketplace-custom-config.js`.

  [documentation](./docs/improving-performance.md) for implementation details.

- [change] Update sharetribe-scripts. **cssnext** (used previously in sharetribe-scripts) has been
  deprecated. Now **postcss-preset-env** is used instead with stage 3 + custom media queries and
  nesting-rules. If this change breaks your styling, you could still use v1.1.2. The next version of
  [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-nesting) (v7.0.0) will no longer

- [fix] Fix window resize redirecting to search page with reusable map component
  [#905](https://github.com/sharetribe/flex-template-web/pull/905)

  provider in use and works with both Google Maps as well as Mapbox.

  The fuzzy location circle has less configuration, but otherwise all the previous settings can be
  set also in the new configuration. See `config.js` for details.

  The default location searches are now enabled in the `.env-template`. For old installations, the
  `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SEARCHES_ENABLED` env var should be set to `true`. The default searches can
  then be configured in `src/default-location-searches.js`.
