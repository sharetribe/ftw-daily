 * Note: props can include a lot of things that depend on

 *   - asset should contain an array of _sections_, which might contain _fields_ and an array of _blocks_
 *     - _blocks_ can also contain _fields_
 * - fallbackPage: component. If asset loading fails, this is used instead.
 * - options: extra mapping of 3 level of sub components
 *   - sectionComponents: { ['my-section-type']: { component: MySection } }
 *   - blockComponents: { ['my-component-type']: { component: MyBlock } }
 *   - fieldComponents: { ['my-field-type']: { component: MyField, pickValidProps: data => Number.isInteger(data.content) ? { content: data.content } : {} }

                      We are passionate about pets and understand the need for reliable and
                      trustworthy pet care services. Our platform connects Pet Owners with Pet
                      Hosts who are committed to providing the best possible care for your furry
                      family members.
                      Our mission is to make pet care services accessible and affordable for
                      everyone, while also providing a platform for Pet Hosts to build their
                      business and gain exposure to new clients. We believe that by creating a
                      community of Pet Owners and Pet Hosts, we can make a positive impact
                      on the lives of pets and their humans.
                      Our team consists of experienced professionals in the pet care industry,
                      as well as technology experts who are dedicated to creating a seamless
                      and user-friendly platform.
                      We understand that pets are an important part of your life, and we are
                      committed to making sure they receive the attention, care, and love they
                      deserve while you are away.
                      We take the safety and well-being of pets very seriously and have
                      implemented strict vetting processes for our Pet Hosts so you can feel
                      confident that your pet is in good hands. All Pet Hosts must provide
                      information about their experience, credentials and pass a safety test and
                      we encourage Pet Owners to review Pet Hosts' profiles and ratings before
                      booking.
                      We are based in Sydney, Australia and are committed to serving the
                      Australian community. We believe that by supporting local Pet Hosts and
                      Pet Owners, we can create a stronger and more connected pet care
                      community across Australia. We are not trying to sell you fancy products
                      or other pet services. Our focus is on pet care and we are constantly
                      working to improve our platform and welcome feedback from our users.

                      We look forward to connecting you with the best Pet Hosts in your area!

                          In case of an emergency, Pet Owners should first contact the Pet Hosts
                          and then seek veterinary care as needed. Bookings that are made on
                          PetCrib are covered under our â€˜xâ€™ insurance policy.

                        <div className={css.accordanceBoxWrap}>
                          We understand that plans can change, and sometimes it may be
                          necessary for you to cancel a booking on PetCrib. However, please note
                          that cancelling a booking can cause inconvenience to the Pet Host. We
                          have put in place some policies to outline what the process may be in
                          each situation. Our Cancellation Policy and Refund procedures are
                          outlined in our Terms of Service.
                          If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking after it has been paid for, but before the
                          booking start the Pet Owner will be required to pay any applicable
                          Cancellation Fee to the relevant Pet Host (depending on the cancellation
                          policy selected by the Pet Host).
                          PetCrib allows Pet Hosts to choose their cancellation policy from three
                          different policies we have set. Pet Owners can view the cancellation policy
                          on the Pet Hostâ€™s public profile before making a Booking.
                          The three cancellation policies are:
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Flexible Policy</strong> - a full refund will only be available if the Booking is
                              cancelled 1 day before the Booking commences;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Moderate Policy</strong> - a full refund will only be available if the Booking
                              is cancelled before 7 days before the Booking commences; and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Strict Policy</strong> - a full refund will only be available if the Booking is
                              cancelled before 14 days before the Booking commences.
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                          If a Booking is cancelled before the timeframe specified in the Pet Host's
                          chosen cancellation policy, the Pet Owner will receive a full refund of the
                          Service Fee. Please note:  Our Booking Fee is non-refundable when a
                          booking is cancelled by the Pet Owner.
                          If the cancellation occurs within the timeframe of the cancellation policy,
                          then the Pet Owner will receive a refund of 50% of the Service fee. Please
                          note: The Booking Fee is non-refundable when a booking is cancelled by
                          the owner. In this scenario, if the Pet Host is owed the cancellation fee
                          (50% of the Service Fee, minus Our Platform Fee) this will then be
                          deposited into the Pet Hosts nominated bank account.
                          All ongoing Repeat Weekly Bookings without a specified end date are
                          subject to the Flexible policy regardless of the Cancellation Policy the Pet
                          Host has set forth in their profile. Read more about this specific policy
                          here.
                          Please note that in exceptional circumstances, such as a medical
                          emergency or natural disaster, we may waive our cancellation policy. In
                          such cases, please inform us as soon as possible so we can work with you
                          to find a solution that is fair to both you and the Pet Host.
                          If a Pet Host cancel's a paid booking, the Pet Host is required to
                          immediately message the Pet Owner and cancel it via the booking details.
                          PetCrib will refund the full amount paid to the Pet Owner, and we will aim
                          to help the Pet Owner find a replacement Pet Host. Depending on the
                          circumstances surrounding the cancellation we may flag the Pet Hostâ€™s
                          profile. If more than two paid bookings are cancelled within two months,
                          PetCrib may suspend or remove the Pet Host's profile.
                          PetCrib aims to ensure that once a booking is paid for, it is secured and
                          locked in. We understand that sometimes Pet Hosts need to cancel, either
                          due to an emergency or an unavoidable circumstance. However, once a
                          booking has been paid for we want to keep cancellations by Pet Hosts to a
                          minimum.

                          Pet Hosting is the general term used to describe looking after other
                          people's pets when the Pet Owner is away.
                          Pet Hosting includes looking after pets at the Pet Hosts house, either
                          overnight or during the day (also known as day care).
                          A Pet Hosts roles and responsibilities include:

                          a Pet Host on PetCrib is a very easy process. A Pet Host can create a

                          their pet preferences, availability, pricing, experience and credentials.  Pet
                          Hosts will also need to pass a Safety Test and upload a background check.

                            <li>
                              - You must be at least 18 years of age to become a Pet Host on

                            <li>
                              - Pet Hosts on PetCrib are considered independent contractors. This
                              means that you'll be running your own small business on PetCrib
                              and won't be considered a PetCrib employee.

                          Before hosting a pet at your home, here are some tips to help you
                          prepare:
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              Pet-proof your Crib: Make sure your Crib is safe for pets. This means
                              removing any hazardous items or materials that the pet may be
                              able to access.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Familiarise yourself with the pet's needs: Before the pet arrives,
                              make sure you are aware of any special needs or requirements the
                              pet may have. This could include dietary restrictions, medications,
                              or exercise needs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Create a pet-friendly space: Set up a comfortable space for the pet
                              to stay during their visit. This could include a cozy bed, toys, and
                              water and food dishes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Have a plan for emergencies: In the unlikely event of an emergency,
                              it's important to have a plan in place. Make sure you have the
                              contact information for the nearest veterinarian or the Pet Ownerâ€™s
                              preferred vet.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Communicate with the Pet Owner: Communicate with the Pet Owner
                              to ensure you understand their expectations and preferences for
                              their pet's time at your Crib. This will help ensure a smooth and
                              positive experience for both you and the pet.

                        <div className={css.accordanceBoxWrap}>
                          Here are some recommendations for a Pet Host:
                          1. Familiarise yourself with the pet's needs: Before agreeing to provide
                          pet care services, make sure you understand the pet's needs. Ask
                          the Pet Owner about the pet's feeding schedule, exercise routine,
                          medication needs, and any other special instructions.
                          2. Get to know the pet: Spend time with the pet before the pet owner
                          leaves to get to know their personality and behaviour. This can help
                          you anticipate the pet's needs and ensure that you provide the best
                          possible care.
                          3. Have a plan for emergencies: Make sure you have a plan in place in
                          case of an emergency. This may include knowing the location of the
                          nearest veterinary clinic, having a first aid kit on hand, and knowing
                          who to contact in case of an emergency.
                          4. Communicate with the pet owner: Make sure you communicate
                          regularly with the Pet Owner while they are away. This can include
                          sending updates on the pet's well-being and any issues that arise.
                          5. Maintain a safe and secure environment: Ensure that the pet's
                          environment is safe and secure, free from hazards that could harm
                          the pet. Make sure that the pet has proper identification, such as a
                          collar with tags and/or a microchip, and that the pet's area is
                          escape-proof.
                          By following these recommendations, a Pet Host can better prepare
                          themselves to provide quality care to pets while their owners are away.

                          We understand, things happen outside of our control. Pet Hosts are
                          responsible for providing emergency contact information in their profiles.
                          In case of an emergency, the Pet Host should first contact the Pet Owner
                          and then seek veterinary care as needed.

                          We require all Pet Hosts to provide information about their experience
                          and credentials, and we encourage Pet Owners to review Pet Hosts'
                          profiles and ratings before booking. We also provide a platform for
                          communication between Pet Owners and Pet Hosts to ensure that all
                          details are agreed upon prior to the booking.

                        <div className={css.accordanceBoxWrap}>
                          We understand that plans can change, and sometimes it may be
                          necessary for you to cancel a booking on PetCrib. However, please note
                          that cancelling a booking can cause inconvenience to the Pet Host. We
                          have put in place some policies to outline what the process may be in
                          each situation. Our Cancellation Policy and Refund procedures are
                          outlined in our Terms of Service.
                          If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking after it has been paid for, but before the
                          booking start the Pet Owner will be required to pay any applicable
                          Cancellation Fee to the relevant Pet Host (depending on the cancellation
                          policy selected by the Pet Host).
                          PetCrib allows Pet Hosts to choose their cancellation policy from three
                          different policies we have set. Pet Owners can view the cancellation policy
                          on the Pet Hostâ€™s public profile before making a Booking.
                          The three cancellation policies are:
                          (4)Flexible Policy - a full refund will only be available if the Booking is
                          cancelled 1 day before the Booking commences;
                          (5)Moderate Policy - a full refund will only be available if the Booking
                          is cancelled before 7 days before the Booking commences; and
                          (6)Strict Policy - a full refund will only be available if the Booking is
                          cancelled before 14 days before the Booking commences.
                          If a Booking is cancelled before the timeframe specified in the Pet Host's
                          chosen cancellation policy, the Pet Owner will receive a full refund of the
                          Service Fee. Please note:  Our Booking Fee is non-refundable when a
                          booking is cancelled by the Pet Owner.
                          If the cancellation occurs within the timeframe of the cancellation policy,
                          then the Pet Owner will receive a refund of 50% of the Service fee. Please
                          note: The Booking Fee is non-refundable when a booking is cancelled by
                          the owner. In this scenario, if the Pet Host is owed the cancellation fee
                          (50% of the Service Fee, minus Our Platform Fee) this will then be
                          deposited into the Pet Hosts nominated bank account.
                          All ongoing Repeat Weekly Bookings without a specified end date are
                          subject to the Flexible policy regardless of the Cancellation Policy the Pet
                          Host has set forth in their profile. Read more about this specific policy
                          here.
                          Please note that in exceptional circumstances, such as a medical
                          emergency or natural disaster, we may waive our cancellation policy. In
                          such cases, please inform us as soon as possible so we can work with you
                          to find a solution that is fair to both you and the Pet Host.
                          If a Pet Host cancel's a paid booking, the Pet Host is required to
                          immediately message the Pet Owner and cancel it via the booking details.
                          PetCrib will refund the full amount paid to the Pet Owner, and we will aim
                          to help the Pet Owner find a replacement Pet Host. Depending on the
                          circumstances surrounding the cancellation we may flag the Pet Hostâ€™s
                          profile. If more than two paid bookings are cancelled within two months,
                          PetCrib may suspend or remove the Pet Host's profile.
                          PetCrib aims to ensure that once a booking is paid for, it is secured and
                          locked in. We understand that sometimes Pet Hosts need to cancel, either
                          due to an emergency or an unavoidable circumstance. However, once a
                          booking has been paid for we want to keep cancellations by Pet Hosts to a
                          minimum.
