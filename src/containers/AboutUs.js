    <div>Welcome to PetCrib! 
    We are passionate about pets and understand the need for reliable and 
    trustworthy pet care services. Our platform connects Pet Owners with Pet 
    Hosts who are committed to providing the best possible care for your furry
    family members.
    Our mission is to make pet care services accessible and affordable for 
    everyone, while also providing a platform for Pet Hosts to build their 
    business and gain exposure to new clients. We believe that by creating a 
    community of Pet Owners and Pet Hosts, we can make a positive impact 
    on the lives of pets and their humans.
    Our team consists of experienced professionals in the pet care industry, 
    as well as technology experts who are dedicated to creating a seamless 
    and user-friendly platform. 
    We understand that pets are an important part of your life, and we are 
    committed to making sure they receive the attention, care, and love they 
    deserve while you are away. 
    We take the safety and well-being of pets very seriously and have 
    implemented strict vetting processes for our Pet Hosts so you can feel 
    confident that your pet is in good hands. All Pet Hosts must provide 
    information about their experience, credentials and pass a safety test and 
    we encourage Pet Owners to review Pet Hosts' profiles and ratings before 
    booking.
    We are based in Sydney, Australia and are committed to serving the 
    Australian community. We believe that by supporting local Pet Hosts and 
    Pet Owners, we can create a stronger and more connected pet care 
    community across Australia. We are not trying to sell you fancy products 
    or other pet services. Our focus is on pet care and we are constantly 
    working to improve our platform and welcome feedback from our users. 
    We look forward to connecting you with the best Pet Hosts in your area! </div>
