      <h2>Services Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        This JAMinTime Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is a contract between JAMinTime, LLC. (“JAMinTime” or “we”) and the person(s) that are registered with JAMinTime (“user” or “you”). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the JAMinTime marketplace to book or list studios or other studio services through our website or apps, and governs your studio for other users; and establishes the obligations owed between you and JAMinTime, and between you and other users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout this Agreement, the term “Service” means the service allowing you to book music studios or offer your music studio and studio services to others through our website or apps (the “Platform”). The term Service does not include any services provided by third parties. The terms “Artist” and “Studio” refer to the party Booking or Listing a Studio, respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        A “Studio” is the physical space or music studio that is made available to an Artist to use during specific times, and subject to specific Fees and any site-specific terms or limitations. A Studio may “List” a Studio by providing certain details about the Studio including availability, pricing, and terms or limitations of use; this posting about a Studio is called a “Listing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        An artist may “Book” a Studio by accepting the times, fees, and any additional terms (such as fees for Additional Engineering Services) or limitations of the Listing. A “Booking” is (i) only the grant of a limited, temporary, revocable license to use a Studio, and (ii) if applicable, a contract for Studio Services, in the manner, for the time, and subject to all restrictions provided, subject to this Agreement, and as confirmed through the Platform. The scope of the use, including times, specific fees, and other additional terms or limitations, constitutes a “Booking Agreement” that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement and referenced policies. A Booking does not provide you a lease but only allows you limited access to use the Studio or other service only as permitted in the Agreement and, as applicable, the Booking Agreement.

The party filing the User Dispute will be responsible for payment of any costs associated with that filing, including costs borne by JAMinTime. As a part of the User Dispute, you may also seek to recover these costs if you prevail.</p></li>
          <li type="disc"><p> (ii) if the amount of the dispute, claim or controversy is reasonably $25,000 or more, resolution shall be before a single arbitrator and administered by JAMS. This includes but is not limited to any statutory or common law claims relating to breach, enforcement, or interpretation of this Agreement and any Booking Agreement. Any such arbitration will take place in the county where the Booked or Listed Studio is located, unless you and JAMinTime mutually agree otherwise. The arbitrator will apply the substantive Laws of California. All claims from $25,000 to $250,000 shall be subject to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) will govern all such arbitrations under this Agreement. To initiate such an arbitration, a party will provide a written demand that states both the basis of the claim and the desired relief. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in this Agreement affects the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Once arbitration is initiated as provided in Subsections (i) or (ii) above, the parties will share the costs of the arbitration, facilities, and arbitration reporters (as necessary) equally except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator. Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and legal costs. The arbitrator may award the prevailing party recovery of any of the costs of arbitration or legal fees as they see appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator may provide for any monetary or other remedies that are available under applicable Law but may not modify the terms of this Agreement or any Booking Agreement. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned decision addressing the specifics of the dispute. The decision is binding and not subject to appeal. The parties will act promptly to respect the decision of the arbitrator, including payment of any amounts owed or taking of any action required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(b) Certain Claims Excluded.</strong> Notwithstanding Section 4.2(a), the parties agree that any claims based on ownership or misuse of the other party’s intellectual property—including patents, copyrights, or trademarks—may be brought before the state or Federal courts in California. Either party may also seek provisional remedies for injunctive relief under such claims from a court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><i>(c) Class Action and Jury Waiver.</i> Each party agrees that any action or claim arising from or related to this Agreement or any Booking Agreement may only be brought on an individual basis and not part of a class action or consolidated arbitration, or join claims with other users or third parties. Further, each party expressly waives its right to a jury in arbitration and court, where permitted. You may opt-out of this class action and jury waiver described in Section 4.2(c) by emailing us at info@audiobarn.ca within 30 days of your first use of the Platform or Services. You must include your name, phone number, physical address, and email address in your opt-out notice. This is your only mechanism for opting out of this Section 4.2(c) and failure to do so as described constitutes your consent to this waiver. If you choose to opt out of this Section 4.2(c), please note that all other provisions in this Agreement will remain intact and in full force and effect.</strong>        
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(d) Conflict of Rules.</strong> If any provision of this Section 4.2 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the reviewing court or arbitrator, as applicable, will interpret or revise the provisions only as minimally necessary to comply with Law. All the other provisions will remain enforceable and intact as written.

Upon review and investigation, we will either (a) provide you and the other user our conclusion based on the summary provided, which you agree to accept as final and binding determination with the same force and effect as if determined through arbitration as provided in Section 4.2; or (b) require that the dispute is resolved through binding arbitration adjudicated by a third party as provided in Section 4.2(a). The party filing the User Dispute will be responsible for payment of any costs associated with that filing, including costs borne by JAMinTime. As a part of the User Dispute, you may also seek to recover these costs if you prevail. Any payments held by JAMinTime pending final resolution of a User Dispute shall be disbursed by JAMinTime as determined by JAMinTime, the arbitrator, or a court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(b) User Disputes Under $25,000.</strong> After following the process outlined above, if the User Dispute relates to an amount reasonably less than $25,000, you agree to submit the User Dispute to binding arbitration as provided in Section 4.2(a)(i) above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(c) User Disputes of $25,000 or higher.</strong> After following the process outlined above, if the User Dispute relates to an amount reasonably $25,000 or more, you agree to submit the User Dispute to binding arbitration as provided in Section 4.2(a)(ii) above.
